# Household Energy Consumption Analysis & Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical household electricity consumption data to understand usage behavior, detect temporal patterns, and forecast future energy demand. The goal is to bridge raw energy data and decision-making by combining Python-based analytics with interactive Tableau dashboards for clear, actionable insights.



## 💻 Tools Used
- Python – Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, time-series modeling, and machine learning implementation
- Machine Learning Libraries – Regression models, forecasting techniques, and model evaluation
- Time Series Modeling – ARIMA/SARIMA-based forecasting and temporal feature extraction
- SQL – Data querying, aggregation, and structured data analysis
- Tableau – Interactive dashboards, KPI tracking, trend visualization, and insight presentation
- Figma – Dashboard background design and visual layout planning
