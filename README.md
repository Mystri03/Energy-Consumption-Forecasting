# Household Energy Consumption Analysis & Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical household electricity consumption data to understand usage behavior, detect temporal patterns, and forecast future energy demand. The goal is to bridge raw energy data and decision-making by combining Python-based analytics with interactive Tableau dashboards for clear, actionable insights.



## 💻 Tools Used
- Python – Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering
- Machine Learning Libraries – Regression models, forecasting techniques, and model evaluation
- Time Series Modeling – ARIMA/SARIMA-based forecasting and temporal feature extraction
- SQL – Data querying, aggregation, and structured data analysis
- Tableau – Interactive dashboards, KPI tracking, trend visualization, and insight presentation
- Figma – Dashboard background design and visual layout planning

## 🛠 Techniques Applied
1) Data Preparation & EDA
    - Data cleaning and handling missing values
    - Distribution and correlation analysis
    - Skewness and variance interpretation
    - Exploratory visual analysis

2) Time Series Analysis
    - Datetime parsing and feature extraction
    - Trend and seasonality detection
    - Temporal pattern identification

3) Feature Engineering
    -  Creation of lag features
    - Time-based variables (hour, day, weekday)
    - Rolling statistics for short-term behavior analysis

4) Machine Learning & Forecasting
    - Regression-based forecasting models
    - ARIMA/SARIMA time-series modeling
   - Model evaluation using error metrics and residual analysis

5) Visualization & Reporting
  - KPI monitoring
  - Time-based consumption comparison
  - Insight-driven dashboard development
